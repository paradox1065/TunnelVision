# TunnelVision 🏙️🔧  
**AI-Powered Predictive Maintenance for Public Infrastructure in [city, state]**

TunnelVision is an AI-powered predictive maintenance tool designed to help city officials, engineers, and public works departments in **Cupertino, CA** stay ahead of costly infrastructure failures. By analyzing historical data from roads, tunnels, pipelines, pumps, and other municipal systems, TunnelVision predicts when maintenance is likely needed — before outages, hazards, or structural damage occur.

## 🚀 Features

- **Failure Prediction:** Predicts the likelihood of infrastructure failures (roads, water lines, pumps, tunnels, etc.) using historical and environmental data.  
- **Early Alerts:** Notifies public works teams before issues escalate into safety risks or budget-heavy repairs.  
- **Risk Scoring:** Assigns risk levels (low, medium, high) to each asset across **Cupertino, CA**.  
- **Data-Driven Insights:** Reveals patterns behind infrastructure degradation, helping plan maintenance efficiently.  
- **Expandable Architecture:** Designed to eventually support additional public systems (bridges, streetlights, power lines, storm drains, etc.).

## 🧠 How It Works (Simplified)

TunnelVision uses a machine learning model trained on municipal maintenance and failure data. The system:

1. **Collects data** (synthetic or real) including asset age, location, environment, traffic load, weather events, and previous failures.  
2. **Processes the dataset** through a feature engineering pipeline.  
3. **Trains an ML model** (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or LSTM for time-series data).  
4. **Generates predictions** for future failures with a confidence score.  
5. **Outputs alerts & recommendations** through a dashboard or command-line interface for public works teams.  
This project is structured so beginners — even those building their first ML model — can follow along.
