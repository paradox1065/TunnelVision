# TunnelVision 🏠🔧  
**AI-Powered Predictive Maintenance for Homes & Facilities**

TunnelVision is an AI-powered predictive maintenance tool designed to help homeowners and facility managers stay ahead of costly infrastructure failures. By analyzing historical data from pipes, pumps, and other home systems, TunnelVision predicts when maintenance is likely needed — before leaks, bursts, or malfunctions occur.

## 🚀 Features

- **Failure Prediction:** Predicts the likelihood of pipe, pump, and system failures based on historical data and usage patterns.  
- **Early Alerts:** Notifies users before issues escalate into costly damage.  
- **Risk Scoring:** Assigns risk levels (low, medium, high) for each household system.  
- **Data-Driven Insights:** Identifies patterns behind failures, helping schedule maintenance at convenient times.  
- **Expandable Architecture:** Designed to eventually support additional home systems (HVAC, water heater, electrical, etc.).

## 🧠 How It Works (Simplified)

TunnelVision uses a machine learning model trained on historical maintenance and failure data. The system:

1. **Collects data** (synthetic or real) including system age, environment, usage, and previous failures.  
2. **Processes the dataset** through a feature engineering pipeline.  
3. **Trains an ML model** (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or LSTM for time-series data).  
4. **Generates predictions** for future failures with a confidence score.  
5. **Outputs alerts & recommendations** through a user-friendly dashboard or console.

This project is structured so beginners — even those building their first ML model — can follow along.
