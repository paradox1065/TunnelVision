    <h1>AI for Predictive Maintenance</h1>
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>AI can be used to predict when infrastructure, like water pipes, will need maintenance, reducing costly emergency repairs - more of house maintenance than real estate-related</p>
    <h3>Key Features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>When specific parts of a house or infrastructure are likely to fail, the AI model can alert homeowners or maintenance teams in advance.</li>
        <li>By analyzing historical data on repairs and failures, the AI can identify patterns and predict future issues.</li>
        <li>This proactive approach helps in scheduling maintenance during convenient times, minimizing disruption and costs.</
